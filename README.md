# Turing 1810 Frontend Mod1 Static Comp Challenge 2
### Assignment - Recreate given static composition and make it responsive down to 320px width

No assets were given. We could not take liberties with the layout, but our creative license included : Copy, images, icons, and color palette. Page was required to be responsive down to 320px. Extra implementations I added were: A responsive side bar that only came out when button was clicked for a cleaner look, and a dropdown menu for the navigation bar once the width of the screen reduced past a certain width. 

Static composition assigned:
